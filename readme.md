# cssfmt

This project is mainly a mean to learn and practice the Haskell language.

Its goal is to build an (S)CSS formatter inspired by [gofmt](http://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code).
The steps to accomplish this will roughly be:

1. Create a SCSS AST
2. Optionally optimize the code by collapsing and sorting selectors
3. Format the styles
4. Output a CSS or SCSS

More informations will be added if and when the project actually becomes something real.
